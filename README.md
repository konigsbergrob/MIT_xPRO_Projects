<h3> Robert Konigsberg's Pacman Challenge :smile:</h3>

This repository will be used to showcase a project I completed  
during my enrollment in MIT xPRO's Professional Certificate in Coding:  
**Full Stack Development with MERN program.** :sunglasses:

**Name:** Pacman Challenge

**Description:** This was completed as part of week 7 of the program. The intention is to showcase how CSS, HTML and JS can interact with the DOM. Functionality includes generating new Pacmen (with the "Add PacMan" button), and moving them randomly around the screen (with the "Start Game" button - repeatedly clicking this button speeds up the PacMan images). 

**Roadmap for Future Improvements:** I plan to cycle through the PacMan images in the image array. I also may expirement with different images. I also would like to have speed (velocity) depending on position (e.g. those figures on the top of the screen move master than those on the bottom). 


**Usage:** This can be used to help educate beginners about the fundamentals of web development. Albeit simple, it contains many fundamental building blocks used when coding.
