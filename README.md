<h3> Robert Konigsberg's Pacman Challenge :smile:</h3>

This repository will be used to showcase a project I completed  
during my enrollment in MIT xPRO's Professional Certificate in Coding:  
**Full Stack Development with MERN program.** :sunglasses:

**Name:** Pacman Challenge  
**Description:** This was completed as part of week 4 of the program. The intention is to move Pacman across the screen, alternating direction from left to right then right to left. Pacman alternates between 4 images, depending on where it is on the screen, which ultimately enhances the animation.  
**Usage:** This can be used to help educate beginners about the fundamentals of web development. Albeit simple, it contains many fundamental building blocks used when coding.  
**Support:** Feel free to reach out at *konigsbergrobert@gmail.com*
